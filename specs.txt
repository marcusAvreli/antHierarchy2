prepare example pure json data set for sending from rest api to angular client.
data set must have:
1. 7 hierarchy levels
2. up to 150 employees and not less of  75: ceo, cto, managers,employees
3. entries continaing: first name last name entitlement, orgunit code

main purpose of this set up:
1. build lazy loading from rest api
2. memory management on angular site: when user expands all nodes - memory usage increasing, when nodes closed release relevant memory.
3. when memory usage on angular site close to some limit show modal message
4. nodes of tree are togglable
5. tree supports searching without collapsing the tree
6. in case of search: 
	a. without collapsing the tree
	b. when nodes does not exist in memory send request to backend
	c. append search result to existing tree
7. input data has field of parentId[],childId[]
8. input data is flat list without recursion

			existing contract codes
100 ,40 ,30 ,5 ,20 ,4 ,3 ,2 ,1

build recursive function. when function receives null return similar structure with first three minimal contract codes, afterwards function will receive from client next contract code to show.
the purpose is to show hirachical tree of arganization in angular using d3 library. show java endpoint similar to following. 


propose possible parameters that can be used instead of contract codes to show hierachial tree of ofrgnization, show whcih additanl data we can send to angular application. currently i have following data on employee
company_code
company_name
contract_code
cost_center
email
firstName
image
job_key
job_name
lastName
name
org_unit_code
phoneNumber
position_code
title
branch_id
manager_id
